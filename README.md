# Communicate-Data-Findings.

Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (Communicate Data Findings)

Working on this project to understand the impact of a visual to tell the data story. The content of the project is as follows:

Importing Packages and Libraries: We will import or download all the necessary packages and libraries necessary for all our data analysis work during this project.

Gathering Data: We have our data downloaded in csv file from the link provided by Udacity. We will use appropriate pandas library to gather the data into our current workspace or notebook. We are using 'Prosper Loan Data' in this project.

Analysing and Cleaning Data: Once we have our data in place, we will start by simply analyzing the data to see how it looks and its dimensions and other similar aspects. We also list down all the problems and issues we see in the data and then start to rectify them using appropriate code like dropping unnecessary attributes, rectifying the format of some data etc.

Univariate Exploration: In this section we try to plot some selected variables individually that we consider impactful in our analysis.

Bivariate Exploration: Once we see the relation of these variables, we can further narrow down our choice for attributed and try to visualize 2 of them at a time and see their interaction and also try to deduce some information.

Multivariate Exploration: In this last section we will choose 3 variables and try a complex visualization using matplotlib and seaborn libraries and try and verify our readings from previous visualizations.

Finally we provide some conclusion.
